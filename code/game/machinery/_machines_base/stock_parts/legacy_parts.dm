/*
/// EXPLORATION REWARDS ///
Added items that will be random in most ruins/cave areas, they range from packages, reports, lost clothing rolls, to ingots of expensive minerals
and the like.

These items are meant to be randomized rewards that people can find on the caves & ruins, this is to balance
issues such as:

- Bad loot drops (Fighting a cave with 7 mobs to find a lasgun clip)
- Increase actual economy (No longer the RT would have to buy shit serf clothes, shitty pistols)
- Allows the RT to gain certain wealth to sell more of his products and not being solely a Fallout-style shop owner which only buys guns, and armors.

This is more RPG-style and i honestly belive this is more fresh and contributes to a more healthy dungeon/exploration style of gameplay.
