// 40k melee

/*
// A breakdown for how force works. The default material steel -- 1000 is the multiplier.
Your force divisor(unwielded) or force multiplier(wielded) is * against 100. Which gives you total force damage. E.G. Hardness 100 and unwielded divisor of .5 would mean force 50.
To find relevant hardness use VSC Search[hardness = ] to find material values.
Steel = 1000 / Ceramite = 120 / Ceramite Plasteel = 140

All weapons should use twohanded/warhammer -- otherwise it will break.
